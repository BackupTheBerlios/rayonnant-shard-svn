	<h2>Rayonnant Shard Release Information</h2>
	<!--***********************************************************************-->
	<h5>General Information</h5>
	<div>
		The Rayonnant Shard will have three types of releases:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#maps">Map file releases.</a></li>
			<li><a href="#scripts">Definitions and scripts releases.</a></li>
			<li><a href="#phases">Package or phase based releases.</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<!--***********************************************************************-->
	<a id="maps"></a>
	<h5>Map File Releases</h5>
	<div>
		The map files are a vital part to this project. We will have timestamped
		releases with these files. Releases will be provided with BitTorrents to
		promote a shared release system due to these being the largest of the file
		releases.
		<br /><br />
		Example archived map release: <tt>shard-map_YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2</tt><br />
		Example torrent map release: <tt>shard-map_YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2.torrent</tt>
		<br /><br />
		BitTorrents can be made with the following command:<br />
		<tt>btmakemetafile.py shard-map_YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2 \<br />
		&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;http://rayonnant.net:7000/announce \<br />
		&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;--comment "http://shard.rayonnant.net"</tt>
	</div>
	<!--***********************************************************************-->
	<a id="scripts"></a>
	<h5>Definition and Script Releases</h5>
	<div>
		The definitions and scripts are another vital part of the project. These
		are also developed sporadicly so we will also be using a timestamped
		release method here.
		<br /><br />
		Example archived scripts release: <tt>shard-scripts_YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2</tt>
	</div>
	<!--***********************************************************************-->
	<a id="phases"></a>
	<h5>Phase Based Releases</h5>
	<div>
		The Rayonnant Shard has three phases layed out:
		<ul>
			<li>Phase 1: Building of the world's map data.</li>
			<li>Phase 2: Scripting the world's events and objects.</li>
			<li>Phase 3: Bug hunting and general testing.</li>
		</ul>
		Due to the development style of this project, we will have packaged releases
		based on a phase and timestamp method. It is possible for releases to be
		between phases. However we will not be between phase 1 and phase3.
		<br /><br />
		An example of a phase release: <tt>shard_phase1_20050306.tar.bz2</tt>
		<br />
		An example of a mix phased release: <tt>shard_phase1-2_20050306.tar.bz2</tt>
	</div>
